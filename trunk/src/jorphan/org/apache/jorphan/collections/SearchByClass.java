/**
 * Useful for finding all nodes in the tree that represent objects of a
 * particular type. For instance, if your tree contains all strings, and a few
 * StringBuffer objects, you can use the SearchByClass traverser to find all the
 * StringBuffer objects in your tree.
 * <p>
 * Usage is simple. Given a {@link HashTree} object "tree", and a SearchByClass
 * object:
 *
 * <pre>
 * HashTree tree = new HashTree();
 * // ... tree gets filled with objects
 * SearchByClass searcher = new SearchByClass(StringBuffer.class);
 * tree.traverse(searcher);
 * Iterator iter = searcher.getSearchResults().iterator();
 * while (iter.hasNext()) {
 *  StringBuffer foundNode = (StringBuffer) iter.next();
 *  HashTree subTreeOfFoundNode = searcher.getSubTree(foundNode);
 *  //  .... do something with node and subTree...
 * }
 * </pre>
