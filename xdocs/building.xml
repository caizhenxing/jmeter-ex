<section name="Building JMeter and Add-Ons">
<font color="red"><strong>
Note to developers:
This is a very brief overview. 
There is more infomation on the JMeter Wiki.
</strong></font>
<h2>Building Add-Ons</h2>
<p>
There is no need to build JMeter if you just want to build an add-on.
Just download the binary archive and add the jars to the classpath.
You may want to also download the source so it can be used by the IDE.
</p>
<p>See the extras/addons* files in the source tree for some suggestions</p>

<h2>Building JMeter</h2>
<h3>Acquiring the source</h3>
<p>The source and bundled jars can be downloaded from SVN.</p>
<p>Or you can download the binary and source archives for a release and unpack them in the same directory structure.</p>
<h3>Other jars you may need</h3>
<p>
You may also need to download JAF/JavaMail, JMS and JDBC jars
 - see <a href="usermanual/get-started.html">Getting Started</a>
</p>
<h3>Compiling and packaging JMeter using Ant</h3>
<p>
JMeter can be built entirely using Ant; see build.xml for the targets that can be used.
</p>
<h3>Compiling and packaging JMeter using Eclipse</h3>
<p>
Once you have downloaded the source from SVN or the release archives, you can configure Eclipse.
The easiest way to do this is to replace the Eclipse .classpath file with the eclipse.classpath file provided with JMeter.
This will set up the source-paths and most of the libraries.
If you have downloaded any of the optional jars (JavaMail etc) you will need to update the project classpath.
<p>
See also the file eclipse.readme.
