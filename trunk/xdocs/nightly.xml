	<p></p>
	<h2>What are the nightly builds?</h2>
	<p>
	The nightly builds are interim builds that are <b>untested and unsupported</b>.
	<i>Use at your own risk!</i>
	<br/>
	These unreleased builds may not even load, may have undocumented features, 
	known defects, and any number of other issues.
	<br/>
	They are intended for use by developers and others wishing to help with resolving JMeter bugs.
	</p>
	<p>
	<span style="font-size : x-large"><b>These builds should not be used in production.</b></span>
	</p>
	<h2>Where are the nightly builds?</h2>
	<p>There are currently no regular nightly builds - sorry.</p>
    <p>However, occasional builds are made available from 
    <a href="http://people.apache.org/builds/jakarta-jmeter/nightly/">Nightly builds (use at your own risk)</a> 
    </p>
	<h2>What do they consist of?</h2>
<p>
JMeter is distributed as a set of zip (or tar-gz) archive files.

The files are called:
<ul>
<li>jakarta-jmeter-{version}_bin.zip - JMeter binaries</li>
<li>jakarta-jmeter-{version}_lib.zip - 3rd party jar files (rarely changes)</li>
<li>jakarta-jmeter-{version}_src.zip - JMeter source</li>
<li>jakarta-jmeter-{version}_api.zip - JMeter Javadoc (if available)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Installing JMeter runtime</h2>
Download the _bin and _lib files
<br/>
Unpack the archives into the same directory structure
<br/>

The other archives are not needed to run JMeter.
<h2>Building JMeter</h2>
Download the _src, _bin and _lib files
<br/>
Unpack all the archives into the same directory structure
<br/>
<h2>Other jars you may need</h2>
You may also need to download JAF/JavaMail, JMS and JDBC jars
 - see <a href="usermanual/get-started.html">Getting Started</a>
</p>
<h2>Warning - please note!</h2>
<p>
	<span style="font-size : large">
	<b>The nightly builds may or may not work properly - or at all.</b>
	</span>
</p>
<p>
	If there is a problem with a particular version, 
    it may be worth reporting this on the JMeter-dev mailing list and/or trying again in a day or two.
